# Commerce-Website-

# Project Overview
The Cloud-Based Commerce Website is a full-stack online shopping platform designed to run entirely on cloud services such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It enables users to browse products, add items to a cart, place orders, make secure payments, and track order status. The system uses cloud-hosted servers, serverless functions, and managed databases to ensure high performance, automatic scaling, and 24/7 availability.
